<h4 itemprop="name">Randy Klabacka (PI) </h4>
I love learning about evolutionary processes driving patterns in reptiles. I am an assistant professor at Utah Tech University, where I teach genetics and bioinformatics and lead research in functional genomics, population genetics, and evolutionary physiology. When I'm not teaching or doing research, I enjoy going on outdoor adventures with my family (especially to look for cool wildlife), playing sports with friends, and enjoying good company.

<h4 itemprop="name">Baylee Christensen </h4>
I am currently a student at Utah Tech University, and am emphasizing in Bioinformatics. I’m part Utahn, part Michigander, and part Arizonian - I identify exclusively as such! I enjoy arid climates, freshwater lakes, mountaintop views, and shrubbery, but preferably, a mix of all of them together at once. I strive to support conservation and research in St. George Utah, as it is such an ecologically unique place! Some of my interests include finding rare/endemic plant species of the area, indoor and outdoor bouldering, playing tennis, caring for my houseplants, and learning more about Python!
