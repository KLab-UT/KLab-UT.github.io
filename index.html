<h4 itemprop="name">Randy Klabacka (PI) </h4>
<a href="https://randyklabacka.com/Klabacka_CV.pdf"><u> (CV) </u></a> I love learning about evolutionary processes driving patterns in reptiles. I am an assistant professor at Utah Tech University, where I teach genetics and bioinformatics and lead research in functional genomics, population genetics, and evolutionary physiology. When I'm not teaching or doing research, I enjoy going on outdoor adventures with my family (especially to look for cool wildlife), playing sports with friends, and enjoying good company. <a href="https://randyklabacka.com/"> more info at my <u> personal website </u></a>
