<h4 itemprop="name">About Me</h4>

<p>I'm a PhD candidate at Auburn University broadly interested in using genomics and physiology to examine biological phenomena in the context of evolution. I mostly work in squamate reptile systems (because I have an unexplainable love for them!), but I am also interested in evolutionary questions better addressed using other systems (e.g., amphibians, crustaceans, birds, insects, and "fish"). In addition to my life as a graduate student, I also enjoy sports and spending time in the outdoors with my family. Feel free to contact me with any questions!</p>

<p>In 2016 I began a PhD with <a href="https://www.schwartzlab-ecoevolutionarygenomics.org" target="_blank">Dr. Tonia Schwartz</a></h4> and <a href="https://phyletica.org" target="_blank">Dr. Jamie Oaks</a></h4> at Auburn University. I am captivated by the coevolutionary relationship between mitochondrial and nuclear genomes. I am interested in the role sexual reproduction plays in maintaining a healthy mitonuclear marriage, and analyzing the effects of parthenogenesis on mitochondrial dysfunction using physiological methods within a phylogenetic context.</p>

<p>As an undergraduate I joined the labs of <a href="https://siteslab.byu.edu" target="_blank">Dr. Jack Sites</a> and <a href="https://hancocklab.byu.edu" target="_blank">Dr. Chad Hancock</a></h4>. During this time, I discovered a love for hypothesis-driven science. I worked on projects centering on mitochondrial bioenergetics and phylogeography of Central America and Southeast Asia. Within these opportunities I developed questions, collected and analyzed data, and made inferences regarding our findings. I am very grateful to Jack and Chad, and mentors <a href="https://perryleewoodjr.com" target="_blank">Dr. Perry Lee "JR" Wood</a>, <a href="https://biology.byu.edu/kauwe-lab" target="_blank">Dr. John "Keoni" Kauwe</a>, and <a href="https://adamslab.byu.edu/People/Profiles/ByronJAdams,PhD.aspx" target="_blank">Dr. Byron Adams</a> for helping me cultivate a passion for evolutionary biology.</p>

<h4 itemprop="name"><center>Early Life</center></h4>

<p>Growing up in the unforgiving Mojave Desert, one quickly learns of lifeâ€™s struggle for existence. The persistence of animals in such an environment fascinated me, particularly the reptile biodiversity in the backyard of my childhood home. Because my family did not have cable TV or videogame consoles, my brothers and I spent our time outside exploring, catching lizards, and digging up fossils.</p>
