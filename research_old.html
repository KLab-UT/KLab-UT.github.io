	<p>Undergraduate students are working on various research projects within the KLab. These researchers are at various stages of their degree and have diverse research interests. Although most of our projects center around the themes described below, collaboration with other department members who specialize in microbiology, physiology, ecology, and conservation is possible. Students of all levels (freshmen, sophomore, juniors, seniors, and beyond) are welcome to join lab meetings for research discussions and tag along with those who are leading projects. We have weekly lab meetings where we discuss current research, read manuscripts, and work on professional development (curating resumes/CVs, emailing potential employers, preparing for interviews). If you are a student interested in getting involved, contact the lab principle investigator Randy Klabacka (randy.klabacka@utahtech.edu).</p>

<p>We use techniques in genomics to understand genotypic contributions to phenotypes. The genomic underpinnings of aging and lifespan are especially interesting to us, and we are developing projects to understand the genes associated with life history divergence between color morphs of the common side-blotched lizard (<i>Uta stansburiana</i>). Students working on these projects will learn techniques in animal capture, animal care, trait measurements, tissue collection, specimen preparation, database management, DNA extraction, library preparation, raw genomic sequence analyses, and interpretation.

<p>We use techniques in molecular evolution to estimate relationships between populations and species, which we use to (A) see evolutionary patterns between lineages and geographic localities of interest, (B) create models for statistical testing, and (C) provide a more complete picture of biodiversity.</p>

<p>Students in our lab have the opportunity to examine the phylogenetic structure of herpetofauna in and around St. George. Projects in our lab focused on phylogenetics involve field work (collecting samples), DNA extraction, locus amplification (PCR), DNA sequencing, sequence alignment, and phylogeny estimation. St. George, UT is placed at the intersection of multiple geographic regions of interest, including the Mojave Desert, the Great Basin Desert, and the Colorado Plateau. Because of this, many species show population boundaries at this region. If you are a student interested in getting involved, contact the lab principle investigator (Randy Klabacka).</p>

<p>We test hypotheses that explain physiological phenomena in the context of evolutionary history. We are especially interested in the physiology of mitonuclear interactions (processes influenced between proteins encoded by both the nuclear and mitochondrial genomes). <i>Aspidoscelis</i> lizards ("whiptails") are our primary study system. Many lizards within this genus reproduce via parthenogenesis - a clonal mode of reproduction where female lizards create offspring without the involvement of sperm. We found that parthenogenetic lizards of this genus have less endurance and reduced mitochondrial respiration, and are interested in understanding whether this is a result of hybrid incompatibility or mitonuclear incompatibility (among other possible explanations).</p>

<p>Students in our lab have the opportunity to examine the mitochondrial bioenergetics of whiptails. Projects in our lab focused on physiology involve field work (collecting samples), animal care, whole-organism performance (treadmill running), sample preparation (dissections, flash freezing), mitochondrial isolation, high-resolution respirometry, and molecular physiology. </p>
