Rafael Marcondes (<a href="https://www.rafaelmarcondes.com/"> <u>website</u> </a>) is a PhD candidate at LSU's <a href="/quickGRITS/Ep3-BrownBirds"> <u>Museum of Natural Science</u> </a>. Rafa completed B.S. and M.S. degrees in biology at the University of SÃ£o Paulo, after which he began his Ph.D. at LSU. He studies the evolution of bird color, focusing on the natural processes that influence "drab" coloration. In this episode, we discuss his findings from <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/evo.13707"> <u>this study</u> </a> and <a href="https://academic.oup.com/auk/article-abstract/137/3/ukaa026/5834544"> <u>this study</u> </a>, but see all of his publications <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=AWJKAjoAAAAJ&hl=en"> <u>here</u> </a>.
