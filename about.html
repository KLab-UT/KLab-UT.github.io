<p>I'm a PhD candidate at Auburn University broadly interested in examining genomics and physiology in an evolutionary context. I mostly work in reptile and amphibian systems (because I have an unexplainable love for them!), but I am also interested in evolutionary questions better addressed using other systems (e.g., crustaceans, birds, insects, and "fish"). In addition to my life as a graduate student, I also enjoy sports and spending time in outdoor Alabama with my family. Feel free to contact me with any questions!</p>

<p>Growing up in the unforgiving Mojave Desert, one quickly learns of lifeâ€™s struggle for existence. The persistence of animals in such an environment fascinated me, particularly the reptile biodiversity in the backyard of my childhood home. Because my family did not have cable TV or videogame consoles, my brothers and I spent our time outside exploring, catching lizards, and digging up fossils. While attending BYU, I connected with several faculty mentors that helped me cultivate my passion for biology. I frequently found myself in their offices asking questions and being directed to different resources. Finding myself constantly thinking about the natural world and the forces that shape it, I decided to pursue a career in evolutionary biology.</p>
