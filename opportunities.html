			<h4>Comparing accuracy of phylogenetic methods for estimating codivergence</h3>
				<p>Various natural forces can cause two independent lineages to diverge simultaneously (e.g., island fragmentation, aquatic isolation). Several phylogenetic software packages can estimate the probability of these occurances, and differences in their fundamental methodoligies may result in some being more accurate than others. We compared estimations between packages using simulated data, and are now examining these methods using empirical data (from "legacy" datasets).</p>

		<h3>Mitonuclear Phylogenetics</h3>
		<hr style="border-top: dashed 1px;"/>
			<p>In Eukaryotic organisms, DNA resides inside both the nucleus and the mitochondria. Both of these genomes contain information that encodes cellular gene products (e.g., proteins and functional RNA). All of the gene products from the mitochondrial genome perform functions within the mitochondria, whereas the vast majority of gene products from the nuclear genome do not. However, a subset of gene products from the nuclear genome target the mitochondria; these gene products must interact with  those of the mitochondrial genome. Incompatibilities between the gene products can result in decreased mitochondrial function, which can negatively affect cellular, organal, and organismal performance</p>
