<p>We use techniques in molecular evolution to estimate relationships between populations and species, which we use to (A) see evolutionary patterns between lineages and geographic localities of interest, (B) create models for statistical testing, and (C) provide a more complete picture of biodiversity.</p>

<p>Students in our lab have the opportunity to examine the phylogenetic structure of herpetofauna in and around St. George. Projects in our lab focused on phylogenetics involve field work (collecting samples), DNA extraction, locus amplification (PCR), DNA sequencing, sequence alignment, and phylogeny estimation. St. George, UT is placed at the intersection of multiple geographic regions of interest, including the Mojave Desert, the Great Basin Desert, and the ... . Because of this, many species show population boundaries at this region. If you are a student interested in getting involved, contact the lab principle investigator (Randy Klabacka).</p>

<p>We test hypotheses that explain physiological phenomena in the context of evolutionary history. We are especially interested in the physiology of mitonuclear interactions (processes influenced between proteins encoded by both the nuclear and mitochondrial genomes). Aspidoscelis lizards ("whiptails") are our primary study system. Many lizards within this genus reproduce via parthenogenesis - a clonal mode of reproduction where female lizards create offspring without the involvement of sperm. We found that parthenogenetic lizards of this genus have less endurance and reduced mitochondrial respiration, and are interested in understanding whether this is a result of hybrid incompatibility or mitonuclear incompatibility (among other possible explanations).</p>

<p>Students in our lab have the opportunity to examine the mitochondrial bioenergetics of whiptails. Projects in our lab focused on physiology involve field work (collecting samples), animal care, whole-organism performance (treadmill running), sample preparation (dissections, flash freezing), mitochondrial isolation, high-resolution respirometry, and molecular physiology. If you are a student interested in getting involved, contact the lab principle investigator Randy Klabacka.</p>

<p>We use techniques in genomics to understand genotypic contributions to phenotypes.
