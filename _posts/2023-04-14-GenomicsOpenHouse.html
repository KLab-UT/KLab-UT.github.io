<h2 stype="text-align:center"> Genomics Open House<\h2>

<p> The Center for Precision Medicine and Functional Genomics had a ribbon cutting ceremony and open house, and members of the KLab talked with visitors about the bioinformatics program at Utah Tech. Erin Bunch shared her experience as a student completing the bioinformatics certificate, and Dante Celani, Baylee Christensen, and Reagan McKee discussed their research on developing the CatPop software package. We were able to chat about science with many great people from the community! </p>
