<h2 stype="text-align:center"> Fall 2023 Biological Sciences Poster Night.</h2>
<h2 stype="text-align:center"> </h2>

<p> Six KLab students presented their research at the bi-annual Biological Sciences Poster Night. It was a great turn-out, and all of the presenters did awesome at creating their posters, presenting their projects, and answering questions!</p>

<p>David Bean and Alex Everett presented their research on the genetic regions with high conservation across the bacterial tree of life for a protein complex vital for cell viability in gram-negative bacteria (they received 1st place in the research category!). Reagan McKee presented his work on frog genomic scans to understand the genetic structure and potential function of a gene involved in freeze tolerance in a cold-adapted frog species. Dante Celani presented a project he worked on with Laisha Noyes on understanding how phylogenetic relatedness affects bioinformatic mapping success for short-read genomic sequencing data. And Vicente Fernández Lara and Angelina Romero presented their work with co-author Reagan McKee on a putatively non-native population of whiptail lizards in southern Utah. </p>
