<p>Understanding the evolution of organisms that reproduce asexually has been of interest to biologists for the past century. However, because of technological limitations we had little understanding of their genomic structure. With increased accessibility to high-throughput sequencing technologies, examining the genomic characteristics of model and non-model asexual lineages is now feasible. In this blog, I will review publications in the field of asexual genomics as of February 2022.

<p>The Amazon Molly (<em>Poecilia formosa</em>) is an asexual fish (specifically gynogenetic) that is the result of a hybridization event between the Shortfin Molly (<em>Poecilia mexicana</em> and the Sailfin Molly (<em>Poecilia latipinna</em>). </p>

<p>Lu et al. examined transcriptomes from lab-raised <em>P. formosa</em> and compaired them with F1 hybrids resulting from a cross between <em>P. mexicana</em> and <em> P. latipinna</em>. To do this, they collected <em>P. formosa</em>, <em>P. mexicana</em>, and <em>P. latipinna</em> from Mexico and brought them to research labs in Germany. They crossed <em>P. mexicana</em> and <em>P. latipinna</em> individuals to get an F1 similar to <em>P. formosa</em> (Although this was the nearly the same cross that resulted in the origin of the <em>P. formosa</em> lineage, it is important to keep in mind that multiple nuances [such as variation among the parental populations and the accumulation of mutations since the reticulation event] mean that these F1s are different from <em>P. formosa</em>).</p>

<p>While the F1 offspring showed no overall pattern of parental bias in allele expression, <em>P. formosus</em> expression favored paternally inherited alleles (e.g., the <em>P. latipinna</em> alleles).

<p>Most genes with allele-biased expression maintained low levels of the minor-expressed allele, however others silenced the alternate allele (allele-specific expression). This pattern was observed in ovarian, cerebral, and hepatic tissue.</p>

<p><em>Squalius alburnoides</em> is a small, freshwater Cyprinid fish that reproduces asexually via gynogenesis. These fish contain hybrid genomes resulting from an ancient cross between <em>Squalius alburnoides</em> and <em>Squalius hispanica</em>. Matos et al. set out to understand how expression is regulated in these fish of hybrid ancestry.</p>
