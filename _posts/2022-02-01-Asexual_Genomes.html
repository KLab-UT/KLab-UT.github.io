<p>Understanding the evolution of organisms that reproduce asexually has been of interest to biologists for the past century. However, because of technological limitations we had little understanding of their genomic structure. With increased accessibility to high-throughput sequencing technologies, examining the genomic characteristics of model and non-model asexual lineages is now feasible. In this blog, I will review publications in the field of asexual genomics as of February 2022.

<p>The Amazon Molly (<em>Poecilia formosa</em>) is an asexual fish (specifically gynogenetic) that is the result of a hybridization event between the Shortfin Molly (<em>Poecilia mexicana</em> and the Sailfin Molly (<em>Poecilia latipinna</em>). Lu et al. examined transcriptomes from lab-raised <em>P. formosa</em> and compaired them with F1 hybrids resulting from a cross between <em>P. mexicana</em> and <em> P. latipinna</em>.</p>

<p>While the F1 offspring showed no overall pattern of parental bias in allele expression, <em>P. formosus</em> expression favored paternally inherited alleles (e.g., the <em>P. latipinna</em> alleles).
