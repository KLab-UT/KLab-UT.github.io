<h2 stype="text-align:center"> Three KLab students present at Evolution 2023 in Albuquerque</h2>

<p> The KLab hit the road and travelled from the Colorado Plateau to the Chihuahuan Desert to attend the international conference "Evolution 2023". The Evolution meetings are held annually, and are organized by the Society of Systematic Biologists, the Society for the Study of Evolution, and teh American Society of Naturalists. Several thousand of the world's leading biologists attend the meeting, and this year five of those people were from Utah Tech! Baylee Christensen, Candice Johnson, and Reagan McKee presented bioinformatics research during a massive poster session. They spoke with many people during the session, and their hard work was well received! Nathan Hall, who is double majoring in mathematics and biology and working on a research project with Chytrid fungus (in collaboration with UT faculty members Curt Walker and Vinodh Chellamuthu), also attended to enjoy the science and get to know people. We all enjoyed the experience, learned a lot, and developed relationships with other scientists.</p>

<p> Several nights we drove around on nearby rural roads to see if we could find any animals that were warming up on the asphalt, and we lucked into finding three awesome snakes! The long-nosed snake was by far our favorite find.</p>
